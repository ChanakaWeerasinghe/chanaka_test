React Native:

React Native is based on React (a JavaScript framework) to design apps UI using JavaScript. 
It supports both Android and iOS to develop hybrid apps. Basically, 
React Native apps don’t use WebViews to render the app UI as in Cordova.
 A JavaScript interpreter is embedded to run only the JS code of the app.

 

Cordova:

Cordova is another open source JavaScript framework to design hybrid apps. 
Cordova apps use WebViews to render the user interface of the app.
 Cordova also allows developers to use latest web technologies like HTML5, JS, etc. 
to design apps for Android, iOS, and Windows.
